# pacman-ghostAI
A prolog project that demonstrates the AI of a Pacman's ghost.
Using minimum Euclidian distance between the position of Pacman and the ghost.
The coordinates of the available tiles (Non Blue) are encoded in the clauses, as well as the cost of the neighbouring tiles.
Change the goal to whatever positions the ghost and pacman are present on.
This project is used for demonstration purposes, it's not a functioning game.
